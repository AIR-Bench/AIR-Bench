## ‚òÅÔ∏è Motivation

Evaluation is crucial for the development of information retrieval models. In recent years, a series of milestone works have been introduced to the community, such as [MSMARCO](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/), [Natural Question](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions) (open-domain QA), [MIRACL](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl) (multilingual retrieval), [BEIR](https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir/) and [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) (general-domain zero-shot retrieval). However, the existing benchmarks are severely limited in the following perspectives.

- **Incapability of dealing with new domains**. All of the existing benchmarks are static, which means they are established for the pre-defined domains based on human labeled data. Therefore, they are incapable of dealing with new domains which are interested by the users. 
- **Potential risk of over-fitting and data leakage**. The existing retrievers are intensively fine-tuned in order to achieve strong performances on popular benchmarks, like BEIR and MTEB. Despite that these benchmarks are initially designed for zero-shot evaluation of O.O.D. Evaluation, the in-domain training data is widely used during the fine-tuning process. What is worse, given the public availability of the existing evaluation datasets, the testing data could be falsely mixed into the retrievers' training set by mistake. 

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Features

- ü§ñ **Automated**. The testing data is automatically generated by large language models without human intervention. Therefore, it is able to instantly support the evaluation of new domains at a very small cost. Besides, the new testing data is almost impossible to be covered by the training sets of any existing retrievers.
- üîç **Retrieval and RAG-oriented**. The new benchmark is dedicated to the evaluation of retrieval performance. In addition to the typical evaluation scenarios, like open-domain question answering or paraphrase retrieval, the new benchmark also incorporates a new setting called inner-document retrieval which is closely related with today's LLM and RAG applications. In this new setting, the model is expected to retrieve the relevant chunks of a very long documents, which contain the critical information to answer the input question. 
- üîÑ **Heterogeneous** **and Dynamic**: The testing data is generated w.r.t. diverse and constantly augmented domains and languages (i.e. Multi-domain, Multi-lingual). As a result, it is able to provide an increasingly comprehensive evaluation benchmark for the community developers.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Results

We plan to release new test dataset on regular basis. The latest version of is `24.04`. You could check out the results at
[AIR-Bench Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AIR-Bench/leaderboard).

Detailed results are available [here](https://github.com/AIR-Bench/AIR-Bench/blob/main/docs/available_evaluation_results.md).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Usage
### Installation
This repo is used to maintain the codebases for running AIR-Bench evaluation. To run the evaluation, please install `air-benchmark`.

```bash
pip install air-benchmark
```

### Evaluations

Refer to the steps below to run evaluations and submit the results to the leaderboard.

1. Run evaluations
    See the [scripts](https://github.com/AIR-Bench/AIR-Bench/blob/main/scripts) to run evaluations on AIR-Bench for your models.

2. Submit search results
    - Package the output files
      - As for the results without reranking models,

      ```bash
      cd scripts
      python zip_results.py \
      --results_dir search_results \
      --retriever_name [YOUR_RETRIEVAL_MODEL] \
      --save_dir search_results
      ```

      - As for the results with reranking models

      ```bash
      cd scripts
      python zip_results.py \
      --results_dir search_results \
      --retriever_name [YOUR_RETRIEVAL_MODEL] \
      --reranker_name [YOUR_RERANKING_MODEL] \
      --save_dir search_results
      ```

    - Upload the output `.zip` and fill in the model information at [AIR-Bench Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AIR-Bench/leaderboard)
