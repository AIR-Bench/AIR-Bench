## Introduction

### Background & Motivation

Evaluation is crucial for the development of information retrieval models. In recent years, a series of milestone works have been introduced to the community, such as MSMARCO, Natural Question, (open-domain QA), MIRACL (Milti-lingual retrieval), BEIR and MTEB (general-domain zero-shot retrieval). However, the existing benchmarks are severely limited in the following perspectives.

- **Incapability of dealing with new domains**. All of the existing benchmarks are static, which means they are established for the pre-defined domains based on human labeled data. Therefore, they are incapable of dealing with new domains which are interested by the users. 
- **Potential risk of over-fitting and data leakage**. The existing retrievers are intensively fine-tuned in order to achieve strong performances on popular benchmarks, like BEIR and MTEB. Despite that these benchmarks are initially designed for zero-shot evaluation of O.O.D. Evaluation, the in-domain training data is widely used during the fine-tuning process. What is worse, given the public availability of the existing evaluation datasets, the testing data could be falsely mixed into the retrievers' training set by mistake. 

### Features of AIR-Bench

The new benchmark is highlighted for the following new features. 

- **Automated**. The testing data is automatically generated by large language models without human intervention. Therefore, it is able to instantly support the evaluation of new domains at a very small cost. Besides, the new testing data is almost impossible to be covered by the training sets of any existing retrievers.
- **Heterogeneous** **and Dynamic**: The testing data is generated w.r.t. diverse and constantly augmented domains and languages (i.e. Multi-domain, Multi-lingual). As a result, it is able to provide an increasingly comprehensive evaluation benchmark for the community developers.  
- **Retrieval and RAG-oriented**. The new benchmark is dedicated to the evaluation of retrieval performance. In addition to the typical evaluation scenarios, like open-domain question answering or paraphrase retrieval, the new benchmark also incorporates a new setting called inner-document retrieval which is closely related with today's LLM and RAG applications. In this new setting, the model is expected to retrieve the relevant chunks of a very long documents, which contain the critical information to answer the input question.

## Available Evaluation Results

Detailed results are available [here](https://github.com/AIR-Bench/AIR-Bench/blob/main/docs/available_evaluation_results.md).

Analysis about the results:

- **AIR-Bench performance scales with model size**. For example, `multilingual-e5-large` is better than `multilingual-e5-base` and `multilingual-e5-base` is better than `multilingual-e5-small`. This can also be observed in `bge-large-en-v1.5`, `bge-base-en-v1.5` and `bge-small-en-v1.5`.
- **The generated dataset maintains good consistency with the human-labeled dataset**. The Spearman correlation between the rankings on the original MSMARCO dataset and the generated MSMARCO dataset is 0.8945.
- **The performance of the model varies across different domains**. For example, `e5-mistral-7b-instruct` is better than `bge-m3` in the healthcare domain, but `e5-mistral-7b-instruct` is worse than `bge-m3` in the law domain.

## Future Work

- More datasets will be generated to cover more domains and languages in the future.
